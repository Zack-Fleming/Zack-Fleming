- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Zack-Fleming

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software Development, Web Development, and Game Development, Networking, and Linux.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development at the Pensylvania College of Technology. 
     I am currently finishing my second year in my degree, however, I have had this passion for software development
     since High School. I have been programming for about eight years. 

- My current skills:

 - DabaBase Development - MySQL and SQLite
 - Netowrking - Vlans, subnetting, inner-vlan routing, RIP, OSPF, EGIRP, and the basics of BGP
 - Scripting - Linux Shell scripting and scratching the surface of PowerShell
 - General Purpose Languages:
  - Java, I have used the following libraries in my own projects:
   - Swing and AWT - the GUI framework, that comes with Java
   - JavaFX - GUI framework, that contains more balls and swisles than Swing
   - JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity Classes) - a Java API for database controll, using Java
   - MyBatis - Additional SQL API, for more advance features than JDBC (ex: running full SQL cripts, rather than running SQL scripts line by line)
   - Barbecue - Barcode creation and reading library
   - Forge - Java API for modding the game MineCraft
   - Opencsv - API for easy CSV file creation, allows for less code when creating such files
   - USB4Java - USB functionallity for Java (least worked with)
