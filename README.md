- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Zack-Fleming

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software Development, Web Development, Game Development, Networking, and Linux.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development at the Pensylvania College of Technology. 
     I am currently finishing my second year in my degree, however, I have had this passion for software development
     since High School. I have been programming for about eight years. Currently, I am working on a couple of different 
     projects that challenges my knowledge, motivates me to learn new topics, and drives me out of my comfort zone,
     when it comes to my programming practices and methods.

- My current skills:
  - Web Development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP
  - DabaBase Development - MySQL and SQLite
  - Netowrking - Vlans, subnetting, inner-vlan routing, RIP, OSPF, EGIRP, and the basics of BGP
  - Scripting - Linux Shell scripting and scratching the surface of PowerShell
  - General Purpose Languages:
    - Java libraries or technologies I have used:
      - Swing and AWT - the GUI framework, that comes with Java
      - JavaFX - GUI framework, that contains more balls and swisles than Swing
      - JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity Classes) - a Java API for database controll, using Java
      - MyBatis - Additional SQL API, for more advance features than JDBC (ex: running full SQL cripts, rather than running SQL scripts line by line)
      - Barbecue - Barcode creation and reading library
      - Forge - Java API for modding the game MineCraft
      - Opencsv - API for easy CSV file creation, allows for less code when creating such files
      - USB4Java - USB functionallity for Java (least worked with)
      - LibGDX - Java game library (still working on learning this library)
      - LWJGL (LightWeight Java Game Library) - another Java game library (still learning this)
      - Gradle & Maven - Project dependency management and version control
    - Python libraries or technologies I have used:
      - TkInter - GUI framework
      - Scapy - network programming library
      - Pygame - game development API
    - Ruby - mainly with basic CLI-based programs
    - C++ - Unity Game Development and Windows Native Executable programs
    - Kotlin (getting my feet wet, haven't used in a short while)
    - 6502 & x86 assembly (still learning the best programming practices)
    - CBM Basic - Commodore Basic (decent knowledge)
